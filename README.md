# Pattern Break
This is a basic maths puzzle game I created using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. There are four buttons which need to be pressed so that the numbers on each button display the target number. Each button press affects the numbers differently, it is up to the player to work out how each number is affected and then work out the correct combination.
